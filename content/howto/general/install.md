## 5 Troubleshooting {#troubleshooting}

Some people run into problems when installing Studio Pro. One work-around is to restart your system and install the prerequisites separately if they are not already installed. 

The prerequisites are:

* [Microsoft .NET Framework 4.7.2](https://download.microsoft.com/download/6/E/4/6E48E8AB-DC00-419E-9704-06DD46E5F81D/NDP472-KB4054530-x86-x64-AllOS-ENU.exe)
* [AdoptOpenJDK 11](https://cdn.mendix.com/installer/AdoptOpenJDK/OpenJDK11U-jdk_x64_windows_hotspot_11.0.3_7.msi)
* [Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 SP1 Redistributable Package](http://download.microsoft.com/download/A/8/0/A80747C3-41BD-45DF-B505-E9710D2744E0/vcredist_x64.exe)
* [Microsoft Visual C++ 2013 Redistributable Package](http://download.microsoft.com/download/2/E/6/2E61CFA4-993B-4DD4-91DA-3737CD5CD6E3/vcredist_x64.exe)

Based on the error message you get from the installer you can decide to install a single prerequisite, or you can try to manually install them all.

After that you can retry installing Studio Pro.
