This is the official release of the Android and iOS versions of the Make It Native app, with support for Mendix Studio Pro 8.0. The apps are not backwards compatible with the Mendix Studio Pro 8.0.0 Beta versions of Mendix Studio Pro.

## Android 1.0 / iOS 1.0

**Release date: June 21st, 2019**

Both Android and iOS versions allow you to preview and debug your locally running native app project on any supported mobile platform. 

The iOS version contains the following extra features to help new users (which will be available for Android in the future):

* We developed a slideshow which explains the appâ€™s most common features (accessed via the **?** button in the top-right corner).
* We added **Showcase**, a page which lets you view some of Mendix's core and pluggable widgets as well as their Atlas UI styling.
* We enabled access to Mendix documentation directly from the app (accessed via the **?** button in the top-right corner).
